# MADServer

CLI frontend for Shogo: Mobile Armor Division dedicated server library. Because how am I supposed to control GTK 1.2-based GUI if I want to dockerize the server?

# How to compile and run the server

```
$ make
$ cp ./build/madserv <path to Shogo Linux installation>
$ cd <path to Shogo Linux installation>
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./madserv
```

# Usage

TBD
